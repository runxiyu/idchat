idchat
======
Quick and dirty IDCÂ client based on ii.

Status
------
It currently can:

- Connect;
- Send and receive messages.

The Internet Delay Chat protocol is under heavy development and is itself a
rolling release, by Git commits.  Therefore, don't expect this to work with the
latest version of IDC servers all the time, as protocol updates are almost
always incompatible.  As both this client and the main project (which includes
an example server) at <git://git.andrewyu.org/internet-delay-chat> are actively
maintained, such issues are usually quickly discovered and fixed.

You may discuss, report bugs, and send patches to <idc@andrewyu.org>.
Discussion is on IRC, in #IDC on either libera.chat or irc.andrewyu.org.  When
IDC guilds and channels are complete, it will be moved there.

There may be (I hope, not too many) bugs since this is still a WIP.
